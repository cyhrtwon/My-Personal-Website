<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Kezza and I just met this school year but I didn't expect that she<br>would become my best friend that fast. We really have things in common such<br>as drawing, dancing, playing online games, and even solving math problems.<br>She's the first person who made me a charcoal portrait and I'm so<br>glad about that. Usually, I'm the one who draws other people that's why<br>I'm really grateful to receive that gift from her. She's willing to help me<br>whenever I'm in need and I help her too if she needs me.

<font color="black"size="5">

<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Of all my friends, I can say that Rie is the most understanding<br>among them. She's always the first person that I would think of whenever I need<br>some advice because she really gives the best of them. She's like a sister<br>to me because she's very mature and kind. I also just met her<br>this school year yet our personalities clicked well. Rie is also one of<br>my codm buddies and my gbf as well.

<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Shane has been my best friend ever since we were in grade 7<br>and I miss her a lot! We haven't seen each other for months because both of us<br>are busy with school and other personal stuff. However, that didn't affect<br>our friendship. She's still my best friend even if we don't see<br>each other that much. Shane is very funny and we have the same humor that's<br>why things will not be boring if we're together.

I also love<br>her outfits and she looks good in them. I wish to spend more time with<br>her and create more memories together!

<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Gabi is my sassiest friend which makes me love his personality<br>even more! I adore the jokes he tells everyday. He's pretty and doesn't care<br>about what other people say, which is a good personality for me. He's very<br>confident but in a good way that's why I'm really grateful<br>to be his friend.

If she's there, everything feels exciting because she<br>exudes positive energy. Every time I see her dance to a kpop song, I'm in awe<br>because she's so talented. She also loves to draw which makes me like<br>her more as a friend. I hope we may have more time together because she<br>is a good and honest person.

She laughs a lot too just like Lovely but I don't get annoyed<br>because I love seeing them happy. Sophia is very kind and honest about her<br>thoughts and feelings, and I love her for that!

However, I don't see her that much too because<br>we became busy with academics and we have a lot of personal things to do.<br>I hope that we can go out sometime along with Choi and Shane!

<center>
<font color="black"size="5">

<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ I actually didn't expect to be friends with David because<br>at first, he doesn't talk a lot so he seems like a person that is very<br>hard to be friends with. That's my first impression of him but I was<br>wrong because he's actually pretty kind and talkative. We usually talk a lot<br>about food because he's a great cook! He also teaches me about<br>different online games, especially Genshin Impact. We also have the same<br>humor which makes our personalities click.

I don't feel any awkwardness around her even if I just know her for<br>a short period of time. She's very fun to be with too!

<pstyle="font-family:monospace">ˏˋ°•*⁀➷ Just like Zhyra, Yram and I only became friends<br>recently and I hope that I can spend more time with both of them.<br>One of the reasons why she became my friend is that Yram also<br>likes k-pop groups, particularly ENHYPEN. She has a good music<br>taste for that and she's also pretty smart!
